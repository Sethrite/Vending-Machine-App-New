Used ChatGPT on 10/08/2024 to create the home, user, and manufactuerer webpages with HTML code
because we are not super familiar with HTML code. The main features needed were the buttons and
modern designs for the website.

Used ChatGPT on 10/11/2024 to create the vending machine on the website for the user and manufactuerer
code and then we also changed the formating of the pages to seem similar to the sections they are under,
like the user's color of the page being green and the vending machine page being green.
